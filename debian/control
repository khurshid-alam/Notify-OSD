Description: daemon that displays passive pop-up notifications
 The Desktop Notifications framework provides a standard way of doing
 passive pop-up notifications on the Linux desktop.  These are
 designed to notify the user of something without interrupting their
 work with a dialog box that they must close.  Passive popups can
 automatically disappear after a short period of time.
