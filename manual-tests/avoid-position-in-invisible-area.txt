1.) Have a two-monitor setup and configure the displays in such a way that the
vertical resolution between the two monitors differs by at least 100 pixels.
Align the displays at the bottom edge! Make the monitor with the lower vertical
resolution the primary display.

Depending on your GPU/driver combination, you can use the GNOME display-settings
for setting this up or you have to use a tool like nvidia-settings.

2.) Kill and restart notify-osd by doing...

	killall -15 notify-osd
	/usr/lib/notify-osd/notify-osd

2.) Set focus-follow off and gravity to 1 with...

	gsettings set com.canonical.notify-osd multihead-mode "dont-focus-follow"
	gsettings set com.canonical.notify-osd gravity 1

4.) Trigger two notifications (a synchronous one and a regular one) with these
commands...

	notify-send "Test bubble" "A regular notification used for testing." -i info
	notify-send " " " " -i info -h string:"x-canonical-private-icon-only":1 -h string:"x-canonical-private-synchronous":1 -i info

5.) You should now see both notifications fully at the visible top-right corner
of the whole screen area.

6.) For RTL-locales you have to flip 1.) - 5.) side-ways of course.
